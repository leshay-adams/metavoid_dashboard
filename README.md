# Metavoid Dashboard
A user management dashboard with other worldly theming. Made with love, Vue 3, Composition API, Tailwind, Typescript &amp; Pinia üíõ The app allows admin users to view (search, filter, sort), edit, create and delete new Avatars (users). I use a mockApi that simulates a REST API. I fetch and handle all user data inside a Pinia store.

**üìÅ Component Architecture**

**Views**

‚Ä¢ AvatarDashboard: 
this is where AvatarList gets imported and other future dashboard components will be imported.

‚Ä¢ AvatarProfile: 
this is the user details page where you can edit the user information as well as delete the specific user.

‚Ä¢ SpawnAvatar: 
a form to create a new user (spawn an avatar)

**Components**

‚Ä¢ AvatarList: 
A table displaying all users and all its data. Pagination component and filtering and sorting files get added here.

‚Ä¢ Pagination: 
Here I setup pagination for the AvatarList component. Buttons contain first, last, previous, next and visible pages. Here I implemented error handling.

**üöÄ Features**

‚Ä¢ Utils to translate role and status into cool themed names 
(eg. admin => üîÆ Overseer of Realities / active => üî¥ inactive => Offline, Link Severed)

‚Ä¢ Composables to use debounce on search and another that holds the filtering / sorting

‚Ä¢ Directive to focus on mount

‚Ä¢ Dark / Light theme switcher with Tailwind

‚Ä¢ Language switcher with i18n supporting English, German and French (implemented only on AvatarList component

‚Ä¢ Route guards (Vue router)

‚Ä¢ TypeScript throughout the app (including Interfaces)

‚Ä¢ Loading states for API calls

‚Ä¢ Simulation delay for API

‚Ä¢ Unit test for deleteing a user (purging an avatar)

**‚õèÔ∏è Additional features I'd add if I had more time / will add in the future**

‚Ä¢ Many more Unit tests (eg. test debounce search / users display correctly)

‚Ä¢ End-to-end testing with Cyprus 

‚Ä¢ Tests for my Pinia stores

‚Ä¢ User avatars (profile pics) using an external api

‚Ä¢ Bulk select and delete users

‚Ä¢ Dashboard cards that display user metrics such as a pie chart that shows the amount of users active vs inactive. 

‚Ä¢ More advanced styling

‚Ä¢ Role based rendering and more...


_PS: I like to write well defined code and I think comments in the code can be messy but I am more than happy to add comments or explain my code in more depth_
